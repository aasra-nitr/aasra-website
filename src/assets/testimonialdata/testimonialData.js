      speaks: "I tell everyone that it was just because of Aasra that I was able to survive in NIT. One day I came to know about Aasra from one of my seniors. I don't know what was going in my mind that time I just randomly walked in the the orientation program. Though not very much interested in the beginning I wrote whatever I felt like writing in the questionnaire, with little or no hope of getting selected. Then one day Adarsh Dangi called me and said you have been alloted sector 21 we will be visiting the sector today, please join us. I was not very excited to be honest while going to the sector 21. When I reached I saw little kids running towards us greeting good afternoon bhaiya and didi. It was really a very emotional moment for me. I was literally feeling as if I am in some different place. Teaching little kids, then playing kitnakitna with them was so much fun. I really enjoyed my two hours in the sector the very first day that I didn't realise how fast the time has passed. While going back in the auto I was just thinking how simple this life is, how simple it is to find happiness in little things. We really don't need a lot of big things to be happy in our lives. It's just the small things that matter. Then onwards I was really excited for my visit. Teaching and playing with Avi, Navya, Honey and Dushyant literally made me feel so happy. I used to forget all my stress that used to bother me just by looking at their innocent faces. And what to say about the members of sector-21. I can go on writing about them and the entire magazine will be filled only by my write up. Sector -21 was my family away from family. Aasra has literally given a new dimension to my life. I miss my sector-21 kids and family each day and especially on the festivals. At the end I would say Thank you Aasra for giving me a reason to stay in NIT for 2 years.",

      speaks: "This is something that happened to me at NIT Rourkela. It was a great experience at AASRA by contributing towards social activity. In my 2nd year, i joined Aasra in sector 2. It is not a club, its a family by working with juniors and seniors as a team. Teaching to the kids gives inner satisfaction that we r contributing something to society while making our career. I still remember the day of Little science yard and Foundation day. My birthday is on 26th January, also the     foundation day of Aasra that gives me a special gift on my birthday. I am missing those golden days. Please take the legacy of Aasra's future ahead. Happy foundation day to all the kids and members of AASRA.",

      speaks: 'AASRA - Truly said it\'s a family not a club. Family that connects with every parts of society. Life most persistent and urgent question is."What are you doing for others?" I think above question is well answered by AASRA each and every time. Still remember those days when we were doing "DIYA PROJECT" one of my favourite the way every people of AASRA worked shows the unity strength what we have and this is what should be continued in future as well. All the best for the future team and I am pretty sure that you guys will continue the legacy in future as well "Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much"',

      speaks: 'AASRA was in true means a second family to me. "We should not be proud that we are privileged in many means than others. Rather it has a greater purpose behind i.e God has made us privileged to be capable to take care of the underprivileged". Taking this is mind and heart, my everyday was dedicated to the betterment of the kids, lift them by every means possible and put a smile in their face. Taking different roles in my tenure- from a member ;to a brother & teacher of kids; to getting opportunity to serve as the Technical Head of AASRA, I must say that I have lived a life. The hardships, the planning,the implementation resulting into heart touching results and seeing the workplace grow with it, I will cherish these moments forever.',

As we all know, the purpose of this club is to serve our community and make a positive impact on the lives of those around us. Through the years, we have worked    tirelessly to achieve this goal, and I am proud of the progress we have made. We have organized countless volunteer events and activities, providing members with the opportunity to give back to those in need. We have also worked to raise awareness about important social issues and advocate for change. It is because of the dedication and hard work of our members that we have been able to achieve so much. As we move forward and become alumni of this club, I encourage you to continue to make a difference in your communities. The skills and experiences you have gained through this club will serve you well in your future endeavors. I also want to take this opportunity to thank our AASRA seniors,faculty advisors, and all well wishers for their constant guidance and support. Without them, we would not have been able to accomplish all that we have. I would love to say that it has been an honor to lead this club and I am proud of all that we have achieved together. I look forward to seeing the impact that AASRA will have in the years to come.",

      speaks: "Being part of AASRA, has been a heartwarming experience. Teaching children at the Jagda, has provided immense satisfaction. Their smiles and achievements, especially when they pass with flying colors, fill me with a sense of accomplishment. These children's determination and resilience inspire me, and through this journey, I've learned the true meaning of service and compassion. The unwavering spirit of them and the lessons I've learned from them have motivated me to continue making a difference in their lives. Being part of AASRA doesn't just entail teaching; it also involves guiding and motivating these children as a brother or friend. Alongside providing education, by  offering emotional support, mentorship, and a sense of belonging.",

      speaks: 'In my second semester, Atul and I joined AASRA to continue our prior teaching careers with children. My entire motivation changed when I made my first visit to Jagda. All I want right now is to be with the kids. Different sensations emanated from their faces. How they used to tell us things like, "Bhaiya aj school me ye padhaya gya." They completely caught me. After each visit, my desire to see the kids again grew stronger. For me, it was a wonderful experience. This is just a short message to everyone reading it: try to interact with kids, be around kids, and be a kid.'

      speaks: "When I was first introduced to AASRA, I was amazed by the dedication of the work the members put forward for underprivileged children. I remember, AASRA was never a club but a family with many didis and bhaiyaâ€™s, who were not only our seniors but constant support, backbone, and councillors in any problems we ever faced in our lives! Then we got to meet the workplace children and the family grew! Visiting the workplaces every day, after the hectic schedule, I used to feel more energized rather than getting tired! With them, I understood how privileged I am, and how I should be more considerate and available and work for such communities! AASRA gave me meaning in life, to work for the needy! To take them along with our success journey! And make them ours! We have come a long way since then! And believe me, it still feels amazing how once AASRA juniors and seniors have now become my blood of my blood! And they are still the ones I am most closed to than my batchmates! When the workplace children still call me up for any emergency or any need I get reminded every time about the timeless bonds I have made here! AASRA has given me a life and a family I would have never imagined! I will be always grateful! Thank you, AASRA! Keep on spreading smiles!",
