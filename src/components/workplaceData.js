    description: "The social service organisation AASRA has been a part of NIT Rourkela for a long time. Since its inception on January 26, 2005, the organisation has touched many people's lives and worked relentlessly to achieve its goal of elevating the impoverished part BECAUSE THEY NEED US. There are currently seven workplaces, Sector-2 being one of them.AASRA developed Sector-2 workplace in 2014 with the assistance of Father Benny (chairperson of CWS hospital).  It is the location of employment that is located the closest to NIT Rourkela. The employer had a lot of trouble managing the kids when there were initially only about 15 of them. At first, only Sector-2 had daily inspections, Monday through Saturday, omitting Sunday.The children of Sector-2 have persevered despite all circumstances and stood out like gems among rocks. For the entire workplace, they have achieved success. The workplace in Sector-2 has evolved into a family for everyone. Most of the participants feel an emotional connection to the children. Because of their frequent interactions, the members and children have developed a close bond. The success of the children in life has evolved into a goal for the group. Because of this, each employee in sector 2 offers the workplace's kids his or her all.",

    description: "AASRA was started in 2005 by a group of five young enthusiasts, and over time it grew into a massive family with hundreds of students and a wide-ranging alumni network. With the goal of helping out the less fortunate members of society, it was started with the mission of giving young people access to education and senior citizens work prospects. Sector 21 is one of AASRA's eight workplaces, which it now occupies despite its tremendous growth.In sector 21, the leprosy colony serves as AASRA's office. Because of the intractable illness that some of the residents there have, the slum has that name. In some cases, slum kids lied about their residence in order to gain acceptance from the community or to be given permission to pay tuition and attend school.Therefore, the members of sector-21 working cooperatively with members of other AASRA workplaces not only visit the workplace on a regular basis to teach the children for free but also celebrate festivals, inspire and support the people in the slum, inform them about employment opportunities, basic cleanliness, etc., provide seasonal employment through the Diya project, train the slum dwellers for various competitions like TET, Navodaya Entrance Exam, etc., organise various events, and so on.",

It is one of those places where kids don't get the education they deserve because of poverty. Underdeveloped, albeit not quite a slum.Anyone can fall in love with this place because of the combination of mountain temples, tiny streams, and lush vegetation. Peace of mind is brought by the evening prayers, lighting, and temple bells. Spirituality is instilled at the lovely sacred site. Sector-6 also includes 'Jagannath Ashram.' The vast majority of people in this place are wage employees. By assisting 40 students with their academics, AASRA assists close to 35 families in Sector 6. Sector-6 is approximately 15Km from NIT campus area and auto is the common mode of transport. Every time family members come to visit, the kids greet them with smiles. Along with academics, the club instructs kids in a variety of other subjects. Everyone struggles in school, but many people excel in other pursuits like sports, dance, singing, etc. In order to improve their skill and knowledge in extracurricular activities, events such as athletics, dancing, debate, etc. are held in addition to academic ones. Children gladly participate in the activities in which they excel.",

We frequently ran out of money trying to keep a positive relationship with those places of employment.In contrast to every other workplace, Chhend's circumstance is completely unique. The kids in this place were extremely reclusive (their world consisted of just their school and their workplace).",
